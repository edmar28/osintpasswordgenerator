# Password Generator for OSINT

Overview

This Python script generates a list of possible passwords based on a person's personal information. It collects inputs such as the person's name, birthdate, favorite food, and other details. The script then generates various combinations of these details and saves them into a file named output.txt. This can be useful in OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) activities, where you may need to generate potential passwords for further analysis.

## Features

- Collects personal information like first name, birthdate, favorite food, etc.
- Generates combinations of 2, 3, or 4 details to form possible passwords.
- Saves generated passwords to a text file (output.txt).
- Offers different case formats for password generation (lowercase, uppercase, capitalized).
